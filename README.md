# Source code for the Joint Structure-Texture model for image decomposition

You may find here the source code of the paper [Joint structure-texture low dimensional modeling for image decomposition with a plug and play framework.](https://www.hal.science/hal-04648963/file/article_pnp_siam.pdf)

The demo.py file may be run in order to produce a simple example of a decomposition with a single regularization function.
